- **Role-Based Access:** Only authenticated users can manage employee records.
- **Real-Time Validations:** Form validation to ensure accurate data input.


## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**: Frontend framework for building UI components
- **Vite**: Build tool for faster React development
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to the backend

### Backend

- **Java**: Backend development
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building RESTful APIs
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing user and employee information
- **Gradle**: Dependency management and build tool

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Java 11+
- PostgreSQL

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NtandoMgo/PRODIGY_FS_02.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-root/backend
   ```
3. Set up your PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE employee_management;
   ```
4. Update the database credentials in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/employee_management
   spring.datasource.username=your-username
   spring.datasource.password=your-password
   ```
5. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-root/frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Register as a new user or log in using existing credentials.
3. Once logged in, you can add, edit, or delete employee records.
