# Employee Management System

This is Task 2 of the PRODIGY Fullstack Internship. It is a web-based employee management system where admins can perform CRUD operations on employee records. The frontend is built with Vite and React, the backend uses Java with Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL serves as the database. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures secure admin access and operations.

## Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Vite (React)
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication
